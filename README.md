# Django React Boilerplate

This template has been created using the tutorial on [Tutorial: Django REST with React (and a sprinkle of testing)](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/drf/#django-rest-with-react-the-react-frontend). This has exaxctly the same code as in tutorial with one exception that this has been configured with `postgresql` instead for the default `sqlite`.

To run, update the database credentials in `djando_react/settings.py` in `DATABASES` variable.
